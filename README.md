# Milestone Project 2

## Film Trivia Memory Card Game

This project is a memory card game for users to play. The rules of the game is to match two cards which are linked via films quote and a 
screenshot of the film. The user clicks on a backwards facing card to reveal the image or quote underneath, this card will stay visable. 

They then must click on another backwards facing card in an attempt to match it. If the match is correct both cards will stay visable.

If the match is incorrect, both cards will turn back over and the user must have another go. This process repeats until all possible matches are made. 

Once all matches are made, a new screen will appear showing the players final score. 

### User Experience

As this game has been remade in multiple different styles on a variety of topics and themes, I wanted to create a version which also incorporates
film trivia as well. I have added instructions on the left of the card container on the landing page of the website, so the user will know the rules of the game on their first visit.

The game is kept simple by only having up to eight possible matches. To increase the challenge and add a competitive element I have added a timer located above the card container. 
This will start when the player turns over their first card. I have notified the player of this timer so they are aware of the multiplier.

At the end of the game the user will be shown another screen detailed how many matches they have made, out of a possible 8, as well as their time taken and what score multiplier they recieved. 
There is a button for the user to reset the game. 


#### User 1
'This is the first time I have visited this website and I don't know what it is.'

#### User 2
'I have never played a card matching game before and I don't know the rules.'

#### User 3
'I have played a card matching game and I want to try and complete the one on this website.'

#### User 4
'I have played a card matching game but I am looking for something that is more of a challenge compared to just matching two pairs.'

#### User 5
'I have played this game before and I remember that my previous score was 800, I want to be able to try and beat that score.'

#### User 6
'I have beaten the games times within different time limits but want to try and get a better time.'


### Wireframe Designs

The following wireframe designs were created before the project began. They were a great way to experiment with different designs and layouts for the landing page and the card 
game layout. The final design is shown below to keep the UX as simple as possible to make it accessible and useable by a wide range of people of all ages. 

Instructions are shown on the left hand sign, making them the most likely to be read first. Large fonts are given to the headings of each paragraph to draw attention on first visit to the page.
