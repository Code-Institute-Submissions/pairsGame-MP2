# Milestone Project 2

## Film Trivia Memory Card Game

This project is a memory card game for users to play. The rules of the game is to match two cards which are linked via films quote and a 
screenshot of the film. The user clicks on a backwards facing card to reveal the image or quote underneath, this card will stay visable. 

They then must click on another backwards facing card in an attempt to match it. If the match is correct both cards will stay visable.

If the match is incorrect, both cards will turn back over and the user must have another go. This process repeats until all possible matches are made. 

Once all matches are made, a new screen will appear showing the players final score. 

### User Experience

As this game has been remade in multiple different styles on a variety of topics and themes, I wanted to create a version which also incorporates
film trivia as well. I have added instructions on the left of the card container on the landing page of the website, so the user will know the rules of the game on their first visit.

The game is kept simple by only having up to eight possible matches. To increase the challenge and add a competitive element I have added a timer located above the card container. 
This will start when the player turns over their first card. I have notified the player of this timer so they are aware of the multiplier.

At the end of the game the user will be shown another screen detailed how many matches they have made, out of a possible 8, as well as their time taken and what score multiplier they recieved. 
There is a button for the user to reset the game.
