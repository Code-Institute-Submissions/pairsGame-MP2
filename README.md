# Milestone Project 2

## Film Trivia Memory Card Game

This project is a memory card game for users to play. The rules of the game is to match two cards which are linked via films quote and a 
screenshot of the film. The user clicks on a backwards facing card to reveal the image or quote underneath, this card will stay visable. 
They then must click on another backwards facing card in an attempt to match it. If the match is correct both cards will stay visable.
If the match is incorrect, both cards will turn back over and the user must have another go.
This process repeats until all possible matches are made. 

### User Experience

As this game has been remade in multiple different styles on a variety of topics and themes, I wanted to create a version which also incorporates
film trivia as well. The user will know the rules of the game via a couple of paragraphs added to the landing page. The game will be kept simple
by only having up to eight possible matches. To increase the challenge and add a competitive element I will also be using a visable timer,
as well a score counter as the play the game.
