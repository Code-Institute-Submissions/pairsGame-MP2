# Testing

These test were all carried out throughout the design and creation process. 
It is presented in a table to clearly show what was being tested, how it was being testing, what the result was and what fix was needed.

## Testing the webpage

|Test | How | Result | Fix |
|-----|-----| -------|-----|
| Cards to sit ontop of each other  | Check the images are correctly placed | The cards were above and below each other   | Added code to the CSS so that the card sit on top|
| Content is shown on the left  |  Look at where the content is on the page | The content was in the middle of the screen, pushing the cards down   | Set position of the content to the left by using:
| Game info   | Look at how the game info is layed out above the cards  | The game info was sat one on top of the other, pushing the cards down   | Add CSS code so that the span elements sit next to each other |
| Screen resolution  | Change the screen resolution   | The cards and content squashed together instead of the cards moving below   |     Added @media rule to CSS to ensure the content is correctly displayed |
| Header font size  | Check the size of the headers compared to the paragraphs  | The header were larger than the paragraphs, however there was too much of a difference   | Added CSS rule to increase the paragraph sizes so that they weren't small on the page             |
| Background animation  | Check the the code used for the background works  | The clouds and stars were working correctly, however there were errors on the console in Chrome indication that they were coming from an insecure http server   | I downloaded the images and put them into the directory so that they were being taken from there instead            |
| Shuffle the Cards button | Check that the button was working correctly  | The button worked correctly after the JavaScript function was written, see below for testing and results    | N/A            |
